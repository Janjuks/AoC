# AoC
Advent of Code challanges

Stared to push these from Day 7.

Day 7: Part 2 was so so similiar to Part 1 that there was no need to push this.

Day 8: Cheated here - replaced all ASCII code representations with "AAAA", because of Regex failed attempt to parse string.

Day 9: Part 1 - Woah, not a single compile until all code was written and it worked like a charm with first time :) Clean solution I'd say.

Day 10: Short and easy, but didn't think it would take so much time.
